Hello! Welcome to my website.  My name is Joe and I’ve been throwing pottery since 2018.  It began as a group birthday event over at [Clayroom Studio](https://www.clayroomsf.com/) in Potrero District and then became a passion and hobby.

I hope you enjoy the pieces I’ve put up.  I only do this part-time as a way to express myself artistically.  Each piece is very special and thoughtfully put together.  

Currently, I’ve worked on a limited series of donut bud vases inspired by a shirt and a subversive message which I feel is quite appropriate in these times.

I’ll post more projects as they come to me.  If you have any suggestions, please feel free to reach out and share your ideas!

Much appreciation and love,

Joe
